<summary>What is the difference between list and tuples in Python?</summary><br><b>
  
* Lists
  * Lists are mutable i.e they can be edited.	
  * Lists are slower than tuples.	
  * List Syntax: list_1 = [10, ‘Chelsea’, 20]
* Tuple
  * Tuples are immutable (tuples are lists which can’t be edited).
  * Tuples are faster than list.
  * Tuple Syntax: tup_1 = (10, ‘Chelsea’ , 20)

<summary>How is memory managed in Python?</summary><br><b>
  
  Memory is managed in Python in the following ways:  
  
    * Memory management in python is managed by Python private heap space. All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap. The programmer does not have access to this private heap. The python interpreter takes care of this instead
    *  The allocation of heap space for Python objects is done by Python’s memory manager. The core API gives access to some tools for the programmer to code
    *  Python also has an inbuilt garbage collector, which recycles all the unused memory and so that it can be made available to the heap space.

* Local Variables:
  * Any variable declared inside a function is known as a local variable. This variable is present in the local space and not in the global space.

<summary>What is GIL?</summary><br><b>
   GIL or the Global Interpreter Lock is a mutex, used to limit access to Python objects. It synchronizes threads and prevents them from running at the same time.
